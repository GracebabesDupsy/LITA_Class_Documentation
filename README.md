### Project Overview
---
I am Amusan Modupeola Bamidele, I am a passionate teacher with the Lagos State Government, I teach biology as a subject, but at point I I was asked to teach computer science since, they had enough biology and chemistry teachers, I had to take it up, this made me to work harder and sought for more knowledge in computer science. I never had any prior knowledge or background in computer science but my love for my learners and quest to be at my best and to ensure that learning  took place has been my motivation for pursuing Data Analysis and any relevant skills.

### Data Sources
---
Throughout my journey, I have worked with diverse data sources, including:
- Public Datasets: I utilized platforms like Kaggle and government databases to practice and enhance my analytical skills.
- Company Data: In my professional experience, I analyzed internal datasets, focusing on sales performance and customer behavior.
### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  -  For Data Cleaning
  -  For Analysis
  -  For Visualization

- SQL - Structured Query Language for Quering of Data
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
---
In my initial phase of data cleaning and preparations, I performed the following actions;
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data Collections and Formatting

### Data Analysis
---
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or expression used during my analysis;

```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
